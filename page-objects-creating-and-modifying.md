  Page Objects in this framework are "pure" page objects. They do not contain
  combined functionality. They simply provide access to each element on a
  specific page.

# Page Objects: Creating and Modifying

## Components of a Page Object: 

* All Page Objects have an Interface and a Concrete Class. The naming of these items follows the same rules noted in the Automation Services [section.](automation-services-creating-and-modifying.md#automation-service-defined)
* Some Page Objects might also have an Elements file, usually for those page objects with a long list of elements.

## 

## How to Modify an Existing Page Object:

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

## How to Create a New Page Object:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
